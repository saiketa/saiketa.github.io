Hello, I am Yize Cai, an incoming Ph.D. student in the Thrust of Internet of Things at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). I will be fortunate to work under the supervision of Prof. [Zhiqing Hong](http://www.zhiqinghong.one/) and Dr. [Baoshen Guo](https://baoshenguo.com/). Before that, I received my B.E. degree in Software Engineering at Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2025.

My research focuses on mobile computing and sensing, with an emphasis on leveraging machine learning and data analytics to address challenges in sensing systems. I am particularly interested in developing foundation models for wearable AI and advancing human activity sensing technologies, aiming to build intelligent, robust, and human-centered mobile systems.
